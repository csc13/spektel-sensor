This was one of the first flights using the sensor in it's target environment, the T-REX 500 RC
heli. I did a lot of bench testing using a light bulb up to 3A. But nor the bulb or the power
supply could have done much more. So this was the first test with more Amps.

I'm using a Spektrum DX9 transmitter with SD card slot. I use the TLM Reader. Here is the result:
