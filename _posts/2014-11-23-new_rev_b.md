The sensor worked and the last capacity measurements were within 3% of the loaded capacity.
So thinks were working fine. But the REV_A board had a major bug on the footprint of the
BMP180 pressure sensor I want to use for the Vario and Altimeter functions. So I tried to 
fix it with the solder iron. At the end I bricked it. One of the PDI lines goes under the
microcontroller and this was the one having a short connection to the ground.

Since I proved everything possible with `REV_A` I went on and designed `REV_B`. It's on
[GitHub](https://github.com/csc13/spektel-sensor/tree/master/hardware/REV_B) right now.

***NOTE: The REV_B is not yet tested. So I don't know if it works!***

### News in REV_B

There are some new features:

- A button for programming
- A voltage reverence of 2048mV to the AREF pin of the XMEGA
- Some **Ferrite Chip Beads** and some small capacities at the IC VCC pins for steady working power

And it has a much smaller footprint of a board size under 35x35mm! So most components have
the 0603 SMD package. This will be a challenge for the soldering I plan to do by hand.
