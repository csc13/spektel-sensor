{"name":"Spektel-sensor","tagline":"Capacity and altitude sensor f√ºr Spektrum telemetry","body":"spektel-sensor\r\n==============\r\n\r\nThis is a small project for a XMEGA based sensor for the Spektrum-RC telemetry system.\r\n![spektrum Sensor Prototype](https://github.com/csc13/spektel-sensor/blob/master/pictures/Prototyp.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe sensor is based on the flowing components:\r\n- Atmel XMEGA32E5\r\n- Allegro ACS758LCB-100U hall effect current sensor\r\n- Bosch BMP180 pressure sensor (planned)\r\n\r\nThe firmware was developed in C using Atmel Studio 6 and the Atmel ASF framework.\r\n\r\n\tNote: The Spektrum RC TM1000 telemetry modul, a DSMX receiver with data port and a \r\n\ttransmitter with telemetry functions are required to use the sensor. Not all Spektrum RC telemetry able\r\n\ttransmitters support all sensors. I use a DX9 for testing.\r\n\r\n### Basic functions\r\nThe sensor measures 25 times a second the actual current, voltage and pressure. From this \r\nit calculates the used capacity, hight and climb rate.\r\n\r\n- Show used capacity of main battery\r\n- Show actual current of main battery\r\n- Show actual voltage of main battery\r\n\r\n### Planned functions\r\n- Show altitude\r\n- Show climb rate\r\n- Show cell voltages of main battery\r\n- Make it somehow programmable (change the current alarm for example)\r\n\r\n### Project Structure\r\n- firmware (compiled firmware for XMEGA)\r\n- flight_logs (from Spektrum transmitter)\r\n- hardware (Eagle PCB files)\r\n- pictures (photos)\r\n- project (Atmel Studio, make files, etc.)\r\n- src (C sources)\r\n\r\n### History\r\n#### 2014-10-28: Initial upload with REV_A board layout\r\n- Please note that REV_A is the initial prototype and has several bugs\r\n\r\n#### 2014-11-02: Added support for RealtimePlotter and arduplot\r\nTwo two great serial monitors based on Processing (https://www.processing.org/).\r\nPlease see https://github.com/sebnil/RealtimePlotter.git and see https://github.com/dahart/arduplot.git).\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
